Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project

## Decision drivers

Recording decisions will help us keep track of what choices have been made and why.

## Considered options

- not recording decisions
- recording decisions outside of repository

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in the article [Documenting Architecture Decisions](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
