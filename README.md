# Cookiecutter Python repository demonstrating how to construct and layer your monorepo

This is a lightweight, reusable Python Cookiecutter template, containing main folder structure you would need for any Python project.

Project contains a basic Python folder structure, Architecture Decision Record & documentation structure, pull request template, as well as CI/CD pipeline with super-linter.

## Quickstart

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher):

```pip install -U cookiecutter```

Generate a Python package project:

```https://github.com/microsoft/cookiecutter_template_for_python```

Navigate to the directory created by the Cookiecutter and initialize it as git repo:

```git init -b main```

Now you can commit and push the newly created folder and repo into your GitHub.
